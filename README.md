# Speech to Text for Transcription Services

This project demonstrates a speech-to-text pipeline using machine learning and audio processing libraries to transcribe spoken language into written text. It is designed for transcription services that require accurate and efficient audio-to-text conversion.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code for preprocessing, model loading, and transcription.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 🧠 Features

- Audio preprocessing using standard techniques (resampling, noise reduction, etc.)
- Speech recognition using state-of-the-art models (e.g., [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper), Wav2Vec, etc.)
- Visualizations of audio waveforms and spectrograms
- Transcription output in text format

## 🛠️ Requirements

You can install the dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install torchaudio librosa numpy matplotlib transformers
```

(Adjust based on exact libraries used in the notebook.)

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb
```

2. Run the cells in sequence:
   - Load and preprocess audio
   - Transcribe using selected model
   - View results and export transcriptions

## 🔍 Example Output

```
Input Audio: sample_audio.wav
Transcribed Text: "Welcome to the meeting. Today we'll be discussing..."
```

## 📌 Notes

- Model performance depends on audio quality.
- Future improvements may include multi-language support and speaker diarization.
